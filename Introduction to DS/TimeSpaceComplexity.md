#  Time and Space Complexity

## Context

In our everyday life we usually perform tasks. We want to make sure we always perform them in the shortest time possible and in the best optimal way
possible. Operations on data structures work the same way, we always want to achieve them in the fastest time possible in an optimal way. 
How can we make sure we achieve those two things? This is when space and time complexity comes in hand. 

## Time Complexity

comming soon got lazy lul 

## Space Complexity
